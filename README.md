# bartholomewtran - My Portfolio
Hello all who visit!

I am Bartholomew Tran, but you can call be Bart. I graduated from San Jose State University with a degree in Management Information Systems, and I’m passionate about IT, data analytics, and machine learning. I love working with Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) and MySQL to dig into data, automate tasks, and find insights that help make better business decisions. Right now, I’m also studying for AWS certification to learn more about cloud computing.

I speak English and Vietnamese fluently, and I’m actively learning Japanese. I’m hoping to find career opportunities in Japan where I can put my skills to good use and keep learning new things. I’ve worked on data analytics projects and enjoy figuring out how to make business processes better using data.

Besides tech, I do some freelance portrait photography on the side, and in my free time I like checking out new tech, building Gunpla, and playing sports like judo, badminton, tennis, and skiing in the winter. I also enjoy playing airsoft whenever I get the chance.

It's nice to meet you all, and I hope we can connect!
